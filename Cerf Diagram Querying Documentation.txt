GRAPHING AND QUERYING CERF DIAGRAM DATA (DOCUMENTATION)
SHASHI VALLABH MAKKAPATI
INSTALLATION
* The project was run and tested on Paraview 5.13.2
* Install module pyvista on Python
* Import the macros on the Macros folder using Tools->Manage Macros on Paraview
* Import the custom filter “tube_2dim.cpd” using Tools->Manage Custom Filters




CREATING VTP FILE FROM GIVEN DATA
Raw data was given of this form in a .txt file.
  


First four columns are of the form x1 y1 x2 y2.
Coordinate Points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are to be joined using a line segment of a specific colour(designated to a critical point type)
Fifth column designates the index of the critical point.
Sixth column is the vertexID which denotes the row number of the coordinates off-file.


User also inputs an off file that contains the coordinates of the simplicial complex. Off file must be of the form:
  

First line first column denotes the row upto which the coordinates are stored, after which other information of the simplicial complex is stored.
Solution
A python code was made to read a text file and generate a vtp file using the python module pyvista.


File name: VTP_creation_from_txt/vtp_creation_with offile


Alternately one can use  VTP_creation_from_txt/vtp_from_txt_file.py if they don't have access to the off-file


User inputs the text file and off file path in quotes.
A vtp file is created in the same file directory as the text file .Vtp file contains the data in raw form but can be opened in paraview.


ADDING FILTERS TO MAKE VTP FILE EASILY READABLE


The previously created vtp file opens without apt scaling,black background and unsuitable colour. So we apply scaling transform,colour maps and axis grid using the paraview GUI after opening the file.


Solution
Required filters were traced and written into a .py python file.This .py file is run using 
” Run Script” on Paraview Python Shell. After running the file on paraview, user input is asked for the file path of the vtp file(in quotes).
File Names:
1. VTP_cerf_viewers/2dim_custom_vtp_viewer for 2 dimensional data
2. VTP_cerf_viewers/view_multi_dim_vtp.py
3. VTP_cerf_viewers/view_vtp_without_off.py if user doesn't have off-file


TIME RANGE QUERYING 
If we want to view only some part of the Cerf Diagram or a given time interval. 
Desired Output
  

Solution
Select the Time_Range object which has been created, slide the lower and upper threshold to view the desired time range,click “Apply”.


VIEWING SELECTED CRITICAL POINTS


Suppose we want to view only some of the critical points(Example: only minima and saddle).The remaining critical points must be hidden out of view.
Solution:
User can click on the “eye icons” next to the desired critical points to view them.
  



VIEWING CERF DIAGRAM PERTAINING TO A CUBOIDAL VOLUME IN SPACE


If we want to view only the cerf edges which correspond to a x_range,y_range and z range, we can use the sliders of the custom filter.




VIEWING BIRTH AND DEATH POINTS
In this context we consider points from which two different critical types emanate as birth points.
Death points are points at which two critical point type meet and stop.


Solution: User runs a python file and user input is asked for the txt cerf file. A macro python file is be used to display the birth or death points.


Creation of birth and death points: Queries/vtp_create_birth_death_points.py
(Vtp files for birth and death will be created in the same folder as the txt file)
Viewing them on Paraview: Macros/birth_death_displayer
VIEWING CERF TRACKS GIVEN A POINT ON THE CERF DIAGRAM
TF DOMAIN
User selects a point on the cerf diagram and the track on which the point lies is displayed.
1. Click on 'Select points on' icon in the toolbar just above the Render view
2. Select a rectangle enclosing the point whose cerf track is desired
3. Go to View->Find data to get the coordinate of the point
4. Run Queries/create_track_TF_domain.py
5. Enter coordinate and txt file path
6. Run Macros/view_cerf_track.py and enter the vtp file that has been created in the same directory as the text file
T-SPACE DOMAIN
This query helps view all cerf tracks passing through a cuboidal space and given time range
* Run Queries/create_track_cuboid_time_range and input the bounds and time range
* Then run Macros/view_cerf_track.py , track vtp would be created in the same directory as the text file
